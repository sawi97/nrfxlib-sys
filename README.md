# nrfxlib-sys

This is a Rust wrapper for the Nordic
[nrfxlib](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrfxlib) set of libraries,
primarily `libbsd` and `liboberon` for the nRF9160.

Any binary which uses this crate is going to need to provide a bunch of C
library functions, because Nordic's library expects them. This includes, but
is not limited to:

* atoi
* snprintf
* strol
* strchr

You can't just link `newlib`, because that defines `memset` which clashes with
the `compiler-builtin` crate's definition of `memset`. Answers on a post-card
please - for now I'm using
[tinyrlibc](https://github.com/thejpster/tinyrlibc).

## Using

In your own program or library, you can depend on this crate in the usual fashion:

```toml
[dependencies]
nrfxlib-sys = "2.0"
```

Or you might prefer the [higher-level wrapper by 42 Technology](https://crates.io/crates/nrfxlib):

```toml
[dependencies]
nrfxlib = "*"
```

Note that you may need to use Nightly Rust and add `-Zfeatures=host_dep` to enable the Cargo #5730 fix.

```console
$ cargo +nightly build -Zfeatures=host_dep
```

## Licence

Any of the code outside the `./third_party` folder is under the [Blue Oak
Licence](./LICENCE.md). Any code inside the `./third_party` folder (include
the Nordic nrfxlib) has its own LICENCE file.
